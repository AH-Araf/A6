            <p class="fw-bold"><span class="text-danger text-decoration-underline">Question:</span> What is the difference between 'let', 'var' and 'const'?</p>
            <p class="fw-bold"><span class="text-success text-decoration-underline">Answer:</span> The main difference between 'let', 'var' and 'const' is- let allows you to declare variables that are limited to the scope of a block statement, or expression on which it is used. The var declares a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope. Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const declarations share some similarities with let declarations.</p>

            <p class="fw-bold"><span class="text-danger text-decoration-underline">Question:</span> What is the difference between arrow function and regular function?</p>
            <p class="fw-bold"><span class="text-success text-decoration-underline">Answer:</span> Arrow function — also called fat arrow function— is a new feature introduced in ES6 that is a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. While both regular JavaScript functions and arrow functions work in a similar manner, there are certain differences between them.</p>

            <p class="fw-bold"><span class="text-danger text-decoration-underline">Question:</span> How does the event loop works in JavaScript?</p>
            <p class="fw-bold"><span class="text-success text-decoration-underline">Answer:</span> The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>
